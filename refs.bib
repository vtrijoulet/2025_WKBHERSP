We analysed 3734 herring from spawning locations and scientific catches of mixed feeding stocks to demonstrate a “one-fits-all” tool with unprecedented accuracy for monitoring spatio-temporal dynamics throughout a large geographical range with complex stock mixing. We re-analysed time-series data (2002–2021) and compared inferences about stock composition with estimates from morphological data. We show that contributions from the western Baltic spring-spawning stock complex, which is under management concern, have likely been overestimated. We also show that a genetically distinctive population of western Baltic autumn spawners, ascribed low fisheries importance, contributes non-negligible and potentially temporally increasing proportions to mixed-stock aggregations, calling for a re-evaluation of stock definitions. MSA data can be implemented in stock assessment and in a variety of applications, including marine ecosystem description, impact assessment of specific fleets, and stock-rebuilding plans.}",

abstract = {Stock assessment models are often used to inform fisheries management and need therefore to be thoroughly validated. Different diagnostics exist to validate models including the analysis of standardized residuals. Standardized residuals are commonly calculated by subtracting prediction from the observation and dividing the result with the estimated standard deviation (i.e., Pearson residuals). Many currently applied stock assessment models fit to compositional observations (e.g., age, length or stock compositions) using multivariate distributions. These distributions create correlation between observations, which are propagated in the residuals if estimated as Pearson. This study shows that using Pearson residuals to analyze goodness of the fit, when data are fitted using a multivariate distribution, is incorrect and one-step-ahead (OSA) or forecast quantile residuals should be used instead. For such distributions, OSA residuals are independent and standard normally distributed for correctly specified models. This study describes the calculation of OSA residuals specifically to de-correlate compositional observations for the multivariate distributions most commonly used in assessment models. This allows composition observations to be evaluated with the same statistical rigor as residuals from uncorrelated observations. This also prevents the possible wrong interpretation of Pearson residuals and the rejection of a correct model. We have developed an R-package that estimates OSA residuals externally to the model for models that do not include random processes. For models that use random processes, the distributions are now developed in Template Model Builder and explained in detail here for internal use.}

@article{thorson2015,
abstract = {Marine fish populations have high variation in cohort strength, and the production of juveniles (recruitment) may have persistent positive or negative residuals (autocorrelation) after accounting for spawning biomass. Autocorrelated recruitment will occur whenever average recruitment levels change between oceanographic regimes or due to predator release, but may also indicate persistent environmental and biological effects on shorter time-scales. Here, we use estimates of recruitment variability and autocorrelation to simulate the stationary distribution of spawning biomass for 100 real-world stocks when unfished, fished at FMSY, or fished following a harvest control rule where fishing mortality decreases as a function of spawning biomass. Results show that unfished stocks have spawning biomass (SB) below its deterministic equilibrium value (SB0) 58$\backslash$$\backslash${\%} of the time, and below 0.5SB0 5$\backslash$$\backslash${\%} of the time on average across all stocks. Similarly, stocks fished at the level producing deterministic maximum sustainable yield (FMSY) are below its deterministic prediction of spawning biomass (SBMSY) 60$\backslash$$\backslash${\%} of the time and below 0.5SBMSY 8$\backslash$$\backslash${\%} of the time. These probabilities are greater for stocks with high recruitment variability, positive autocorrelation, and high natural mortality—traits that are particularly associated with clupeids and scombrids. An elevated probability of stochastic depletion, i.e. biomass below the deterministic equilibrium expectation, implies that management actions required when biomass drops below a threshold may be triggered more frequently than expected. Therefore, we conclude by suggesting that fisheries scientists routinely calculate these probabilities during stock assessments as a decision support tool for fisheries managers.},

Reconciling single-species TACs in the North Sea demersal fisheries using the Fcube mixed-fisheries advice framework. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 68: 1535–1547. Single-species management is a cause of discarding in mixed fisheries, because individual management objectives may not be consistent with each other and the species are caught simultaneously in relatively unselective fishing operations. As such, the total allowable catch (TAC) of one species may be exhausted before the TAC of another, leading to catches of valuable fish that cannot be landed legally. This important issue is, however, usually not quantified and not accounted for in traditional management advice. A simple approach using traditional catch and effort information was developed, estimating catch potentials for distinct fleets (groups of vessels) and métiers (type of activity), and hence quantifying the risks of over- and underquota utilization for the various stocks. This method, named Fcube (Fleet and Fisheries Forecast), was applied successfully to international demersal fisheries in the North Sea and shaped into the advice framework. The substantial overquota catches of North Sea cod likely under the current fisheries regimes are quantified, and it is estimated that the single-species management targets for North Sea cod cannot be achieved unless substantial reductions in TACs of all other stocks and corresponding effort reductions are applied.}",

abstract = {Killer whales, Orcinus orca, are top predators occupying key ecological roles in a variety of ecosystems and are one of the most widely distributed mammals on the planet. In consequence, there has been significant interest in understanding their basic biology and ecology. Long-term studies of Northern Hemisphere killer whales, particularly in the eastern North Pacific (ENP), have identified three ecologically distinct communities or ecotypes in that region. The success of these prominent ENP studies has led to similar efforts at clarifying the role of killer whale ecology in other regions, including Antarctica. In the Southern Hemisphere, killer whales present a range of behavioural, social and morphological characteristics to biologists, who often interpret this as evidence to categorize individuals or groups, and draw general ecological conclusions about these super-predators. Morphologically distinct forms (Type A, B, C, and D) occur in the Southern Ocean and studies of these different forms are often presented in conjunction with evidence for specialised ecology and behaviours. Here we review current knowledge of killer whale ecology and ecotyping globally and present a synthesis of existing knowledge. In particular, we highlight the complexity of killer whale ecology in the Southern Hemisphere and examine this in the context of comparatively well-studied Northern Hemisphere populations. We suggest that assigning erroneous or prefatory ecotypic status in the Southern Hemisphere could be detrimental to subsequent killer whale studies, because unsubstantiated characteristics may be assumed as a result of such classification. On this basis, we also recommend that ecotypic status classification for Southern Ocean killer whale morphotypes be reserved until more evidence-based ecological and taxonomic data are obtained.},

abstract = {Recovery of depleted fish populations has become an important theme in national and international negotiations and commitments regarding sustainability. Although up to 63 of fish stocks worldwide may be in need of rebuilding, only 1 are currently classified as "rebuilding", and fewer yet have been "rebuilt". Recent history in stock recovery provides a rich source of examples of rebuilding plans across a spectrum of execution ("good", "bad", "ugly", and "in progress"). Of 24 depleted stocks with formal plans that successfully reduced the fishing mortality, all but one exhibited signs of recovery. The median instantaneous annual rate of biomass recovery (0.16) was similar to the rate of depletion (-0.14) experienced, but stocks with more vulnerable life histories recovered substantially slower than they had been depleted. Most successful rebuilding programmes have incorporated substantial, measurable reductions in fishing mortality at the onset, rather than relying on incremental small reductions over time. A particularly vexing issue is the differential pace of recovery among relatively productive and unproductive components of mixed-species fisheries. Rebuilding the majority of stocks classified worldwide as "overfished" will take a more effective, consistent, and politically supported stock-recovery paradigm, if society is eventually to meet its articulated sustainability goals for global fisheries. {\textcopyright} United States Government, Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 2010.},

We review the effect of the collapse and investigate whether the increased understanding about the biology, ecology, and stock dynamics gained in the past three decades can aid management to prevent further collapses and improve projections of recovery. Recruitment adds the most uncertainty to estimates of future yield and the potential to reach biomass reference points within a specified time-frame. Stock-recruitment relationships must be viewed as being fluid and dependent on ecosystem change. Likewise, predation mortality changes over time. Management aimed at maximum sustainable yield (MSY) fishing mortality targets implies interannual variation in TACs, and variability in supply is therefore unavoidable. Harvest control rules, when adhered to, aid management greatly. We advocate that well-founded science can substantially contribute to management through improved confidence and increased transparency. At present, we cannot predict the effects of collapse or recovery of a single stock on the ecosystem as a whole. Moreover, as managers try to reconcile commitments to single-species MSY targets with the ecosystem-based approach, they must consider the appropriate management objectives for the North Sea ecosystem as a whole. {\textcopyright} 2010 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

abstract = {Progress with stock recovery plans to date for depleted marine resources is reviewed, based on published and publicly available sources. Most plans began within the last two decades, so quantifying progress is difficult, but some 60 cases were found where a recovery effort had been explicitly tackled by either a closure or restrictive measures, and seven documented case studies were used to draw general conclusions onrecovery procedures and to provide a list of considerations for best practice in recovery planning. More successes were documented for pelagic fisheries than demersals, especially with closures, while spontaneous recoveries of some depleted invertebrate resources seem related to reductions in predator pressure. Few shared, straddling or highly migratory stocks have been restored to date. Most successful recoveries occurredin the centre of the species geographical range and/or in favourable regimes. Success seems to depend on non-discretionary fishery control laws being applied. Depletions aggravated by unfavourable climatic regimes will be difficult to reverse, as illustrated by a simulation. Durations of recovery plans in particular depend on regime, and using stock information from favourable regimes to predict plan duration should be treated with caution. Although successful recoveries to date have tended to be decadal, a considerable proportion are still underway, and are likely to exceed this duration. {\textcopyright} Springer 2005.},

@article{thorson2015,
abstract = {Marine fish populations have high variation in cohort strength, and the production of juveniles (recruitment) may have persistent positive or negative residuals (autocorrelation) after accounting for spawning biomass. Autocorrelated recruitment will occur whenever average recruitment levels change between oceanographic regimes or due to predator release, but may also indicate persistent environmental and biological effects on shorter time-scales. Here, we use estimates of recruitment variability and autocorrelation to simulate the stationary distribution of spawning biomass for 100 real-world stocks when unfished, fished at FMSY, or fished following a harvest control rule where fishing mortality decreases as a function of spawning biomass. Results show that unfished stocks have spawning biomass (SB) below its deterministic equilibrium value (SB0) 58$\backslash$$\backslash${\%} of the time, and below 0.5SB0 5$\backslash$$\backslash${\%} of the time on average across all stocks. Similarly, stocks fished at the level producing deterministic maximum sustainable yield (FMSY) are below its deterministic prediction of spawning biomass (SBMSY) 60$\backslash$$\backslash${\%} of the time and below 0.5SBMSY 8$\backslash$$\backslash${\%} of the time. These probabilities are greater for stocks with high recruitment variability, positive autocorrelation, and high natural mortality—traits that are particularly associated with clupeids and scombrids. An elevated probability of stochastic depletion, i.e. biomass below the deterministic equilibrium expectation, implies that management actions required when biomass drops below a threshold may be triggered more frequently than expected. Therefore, we conclude by suggesting that fisheries scientists routinely calculate these probabilities during stock assessments as a decision support tool for fisheries managers.},

ICES Journal of Marine Science, 64: 149-159. When a stock is depleted, catch reductions are in order, but typically they are implemented only after considerable delay. Delay occurs because fishery management is political, and stricter management, which involves short-term economic loss, is unpopular. Informed of stock decline, managers often hesitate, perhaps pondering the uncertainty of scientific advice, perhaps hoping that a good year class will render action moot. However, management delay itself can have significant costs, when it exacerbates stock decline. To examine the biological consequences of delay, we simulated a spectrum of fisheries under various degrees of delay in management. Increased delay required larger catch reductions, for more years, to recover benchmark stock status (here, spawning-stock biomass at maximum sustainable yield). Management delay caused stock collapse most often under two conditions: (1) when the stock-recruitment relationship was depensatory, or (2) when catchability, unknown to the assessment, was density-dependent and fishing took juveniles. In contrast, prompt management resulted in quicker recoveries and higher cumulative yields from simulated fisheries. Benefits to stock biomass and fishery yield can be high from implementing management promptly.},

put forward by all agencies and organizations responsible for providing scientific advice for the
management of 22 major North Atlantic cod stocks. These frameworks provide a structure for rebuilding
depleted cod stocks and for future sustainable fishing. Unfortunately, in most cases these frameworks
have not been fully implemented. Although information is lacking for some stocks, it would appear
that a large proportion of North Atlantic cod stocks are either experiencing a fishing mortality rate
that exceeds that required to achieve maximum sustainable yield, are at a biomass level far below that
which provides maximum sustainable yield, or have both occurring. Despite this general failure, there
are some notable successes, which have led to stock rebuilding and substantial fisheries, providing an
incentive for striving to achieve rebuilding and sustainable management objectives for other Atlantic
cod stocks. Management frameworks based on harvest control rules that result in fishing mortality
rates below those associated with maximum sustainable yield are essential when stock size is low in
order to rebuild to levels capable of producing maximum sustainable yield. },

Our simulations capture three different types of joint production problems, highlighting the flexibility that exists in terms of achievable catch compositions when quota markets provide the economic incentives to adapt fishing practices to quota availability. These results highlight the importance of capturing the drivers of fishing choices when advising TAC decisions in mixed fisheries.

Fishing practice, gear design, and the ecosystem approach—three case studies demonstrating the effect of management strategy on gear selectivity and discards. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 64: 744–750. A basic tenet of the ecosystem approach to fisheries management is that harvesting is conducted with minimal impact on juvenile fish, non-target species, and marine habitats. A range of technical modifications of fishing gears aimed at improving their selective properties is available to help achieve these goals, but their effectiveness varies. Through three case studies, we describe how management controls influence fishing behaviour and the adoption of more selective gear, and demonstrate how conservation goals can be discouraged or encouraged by the strategy. In Norway, limits set on the maximum quantity of sublegal fish that may be retained on board, in combination with a ban on discarding, resulted in substantial area closures in the Barents Sea. Therefore, to gain access, fishers developed technical modifications to enhance gear selectivity. In both shrimp and demersal trawl fisheries, the modifications are now being used by virtually the whole fleet. To reduce cod mortality in the North Sea, mesh sizes were increased and effort restrictions introduced, but the measures also affected other fleets, notably those targeting Nephrops: fishers for that species reduced their mesh size to prevent loss of target species and to avoid effort restrictions. Although management measures may have resulted in reduced fishing mortality on cod, they placed additional pressure on other stocks by encouraging vessels to switch gears, and it is likely that discard rates have increased. In the eastern Bering Sea fishery for walleye pollock, the adoption of more-selective fishing gears was encouraged by regulations requiring fisheries to be curtailed when bycatch rates of prohibited species are exceeded, leading to underutilization of the target species through premature closures. Fishers now act cooperatively by providing real-time data on bycatch hot spots, allowing tactical fishing decisions to be taken to avoid such areas.}",

We describe case studies of fleet communication programs of the US North Atlantic longline swordfish fishery, US North Pacific and Alaska trawl fisheries, and US Alaska demersal longline fisheries, and identify alternative fleet communication program designs to reduce fisheries bycatch. Evidence supports the inference that these three fleet communication programs substantially reduced fisheries bycatch and provided economic benefits that greatly outweighed operational costs. Fleet communication may be appropriate in fisheries where there are strong economic incentives to reduce bycatch, interactions with bycatch species are rare events, adequate onboard observer coverage exists, and for large fleets, vessels are represented by a fishery association.}

Based on the known behavioural characteristics of cod within a demersal trawl, a new escape panel concept was designed and tested using an alternate haul methodology aboard a 12 m trawler. A modified (henceforth “experimental”) net was made by incorporating an upwardly inclined panel connected to a horizontal middle panel that extends back over and beyond a large mesh escape panel in the lower side of the net extension. The results of 22 paired comparative hauls are presented which demonstrated the relative selectivity of the experimental net by reference to a control net. Catch rate data showed a significant reduction in cod in the experimental net by an estimated 81% (p <  0.001). Importantly, no significant differences in the catches of other main target species were recorded between the two nets. The results indicated that the escape probability of cod increased for larger fish, whereas no significant length effects were found for haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) or plaice (Pleuronectes platessa). Further research and development is recommended to evaluate the escape panel concept in commercial conditions and to optimise this promising method for vessels in the mixed demersal fishery.}

abstract = {Abstract During this study, the effects of epiphytic filamentous algae on the survival of demersal spawned fish eggs were investigated in one of the most important spawning grounds of herring in the western Baltic Sea, which is subject to intense and ongoing eutrophication. In coastal marine ecosystems all over the world, eutrophication is a primary water quality issue, often resulting in mass developments of bloom-forming algae. Macro-algal blooms have immense ecological effects, as they alter the structure and the function of an ecosystem. Numerous fish species are affected, as they depend on those coastal areas for spawning and as juvenile habitats. A comparison of the survival of herring eggs on two natural spawning beds re-vealed an immense impact of a filamentous algal bloom. The mortality rate reached nearly 100\% in the area with massive occurrence of filamentous brown algae. Hypothesizing that the presence of filamentous algae facilitates herring egg mortality, field and laboratory experiments were conducted and revealed particular effects of distinct algal species. The survival rate of artificially spawned eggs on algal substrates and control substrates was compared. Whereas filamentous forms of the green alga Ulva intestinalis induced no immediate effect, significantly higher egg mortality was documented in experiments with the filamentous brown alga Pylaiella littoralis. Considering the ecological and economical importance of herring and other coastal spawners on the one hand and the persisting and increasing effects of eutrophication and climate change on the other hand, the results of our study clearly underpin the necessity to increase global efforts to reduce nutrient loads in coastal waters.},

    abstract = {Recent advances in the application of stock identification methods have revealed inconsistencies between the spatial structure of biological populations and the definition of stock units used in assessment and management. From a fisheries management perspective, stocks are typically assumed to be discrete units with homogeneous vital rates that can be exploited independently of each other. However, the unit stock assumption is often violated leading to spatial mismatches that can bias stock assessment and impede sustainable fisheries management. The primary ecological concern is the potential for overexploitation of unique spawning components, which can lead to loss of productivity and reduced biodiversity along with destabilization of local and regional stock dynamics. Furthermore, ignoring complex population structure and stock connectivity can lead to misperception of the magnitude of fish productivity, which can translate to suboptimal utilization of the resource. We describe approaches that are currently being applied to improve the assessment and management process for marine fish in situations where complex spatial structure has led to an observed mismatch between the scale of biological populations and spatially-defined stock units. The approaches include: (i) status quo management, (ii) “weakest link” management, (iii) spatial and temporal closures, (iv) stock composition analysis, and (v) alteration of stock boundaries. We highlight case studies in the North Atlantic that illustrate each approach and synthesize the lessons learned from these real-world applications. Alignment of biological and management units requires continual monitoring through the application of stock identification methods in conjunction with responsive management to preserve biocomplexity and the natural stability and resilience of fish species.},

    abstract = {Accounting for movement and mixing in stock assessment is important for managing sustainable fisheries, particularly for highly migratory species. However, many fisheries management approaches continue to use single-stock, single-area models to assess mixed-population stocks that are known to have complex movement dynamics. We evaluated a single-stock, single-area stock assessment model’s performance on fishery pseudodata generated using a spatially complex operating model that incorporates movement and mixing of simulated Atlantic bluefin tuna-like populations. Structural model misspecification produced positively biased perceptions of size and productivity of the smaller western population, based on supplement by the larger eastern population, and negatively biased perceptions of the size and productivity of the eastern population due to net movement of fish out of the eastern stock area. This bias could lead to unintended overexploitation of the smaller western population and potential for foregone yield of the larger eastern population. Our findings provide a greater understanding of the effects of movement and mixing on single-stock, single-area model-based management approaches and emphasize the importance of explicitly considering these dynamics in ensuring the sustainability of highly migratory species like Atlantic bluefin tuna.},

    abstract = {Fish that aggregate at predictable locations and times to spawn are often vulnerable to over-exploitation. Seasonal closures have often been implemented in an attempt to alleviate such impacts but the effectiveness of these measures is rarely tested. This study evaluates the effectiveness of a spawning closure for Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) in the Firth of Clyde off the Scottish West Coast (ICES Area VIa). This closure was introduced in March 2001 as an emergency measure to allow as many cod as possible to spawn and avoid the build-up of displaced effort from another spawning closure. Genetic, tagging, and otolith microchemistry investigations indicate that cod inhabiting the Clyde are reproductively isolated from other resident groups in the central and northern part of the Scottish West Coast stock. This study used a beyond-Before-After, Control-Impact approach to compare population trends of the Clyde spawning aggregation before and after the introduced area closure, using two other sub-population spawning grounds as control areas. There was no evidence of local recovery in terms of abundance, biomass, or reduced mortality in the Clyde more than a decade after establishing the closure. Mortality may have remained high because young cod are still caught as bycatch in the Nephrops fishery in the area and the predation rate may have increased due to an expanding whiting population. Considering the state of the already severely depleted Clyde sub-population when the closure was implemented the measure appears to have been too little and too late. The tendency to implement such spawning closures on nearly collapsed stocks may be why these measures often appear to have been ineffective.},

Tag-integrated assessment models can account for spatially explicit population dynamics by modelling multiple population components, each with unique demographics, and estimating movement among them. A tagging submodel is included to calculate predicted tag recaptures, and observed tagging data are incorporated in the objective function to inform estimates of movement and mortality. We describe the tag-integrated assessment framework and demonstrate its use through an application to three stocks of yellowtail flounder (Limanda ferruginea) off New England. Movement among the three yellowtail flounder stocks has been proposed as a potential source of uncertainty in the closed population assessments of each. A tagging study was conducted during 2003–2006 with over 45 000 tagged fish released in the region, and the tagging data were included in the tag-integrated model. Results indicated that movement among stocks was low, estimates of stock size and fishing mortality were similar to those from conventional stock assessments, and incorporating stock connectivity did not resolve residual patterns. Despite low movement estimates, new interpretations of regional stock dynamics may have important implications for regional fisheries management given the source-sink nature of movement estimates.},

These have been evaluated using simulation frameworks, including management strategy evaluation (MSE), but few studies have considered the full spectrum from data-rich to data-limited strategies, in the context of the risk-cost-catch trade-off. This involves evaluating whether the cost of implementing a HS, the risk to the resource and catch taken from the resource have been appropriately balanced, given the value of the resource. HSs implemented for Australian Commonwealth fisheries were placed in eight tiers, ranging from data-rich to data-limited, and their performance evaluated using an MSE based on a full end-to-end ecosystem model. Generally, the risk to the resource increased as fewer data were available, due to biases in the assessments and slow response times to unexpected declines in resource status. The most data-rich tiers maximize discounted catches and profits over a 45-year projection period. However, the opportunity costs response is variable, and shows that the benefit of short-term high catches have to be compensated by resource recovery in the long term. On average, more data leads to improved management in terms of risk of being overfished and not reaching a target, but this requires lower initial catches to recover the resources and lower short-term discounted profits.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Modern management of fish stocks is based on integrating the precautionary approach with the maximum sustainable yield framework. It relies on accurate estimation of precautionary limits, defined as levels of spawning biomass where a stock has reduced reproductive capacity, and harvesting targets aimed to maximise future yields. Therefore, it is heavily depending on productivity assumptions. Most fish stocks are managed assuming that productivity will increase as the stock size decreases (i.e., density dependent compensatory stock and recruitment relationship). However, several biological and ecological processes will result in a decreased productivity below a certain population size, referred to as the Allee effect or depensation. Through a meta-analysis of 81 Northeast Atlantic fish stocks, we investigated the impact of assuming compensatory recruitment in the presence of depensation in fisheries management. Across life histories, depensation results in a 22\% reduction of the fishing mortality rate leading to extinction. On average, the maximum reproductive rate per spawning biomass was found at 35\% of BMSY, which was also the biomass where stocks have a 5\% risk of extinction without fishing. Finally, the presence of depensation resulted in increased rebuilding times when stock spawning biomass falls below the limit reference point. When depensatory effects are present, assuming increasing productivity at low biomass will generally result in over-optimistic perceptions of rebuilding and stock status at biomass below 25\% and 45\% of BMSY in general, and for pelagic stocks respectively. When not accounted for, depensation will potentially lead to unsustainable harvesting practices of marine living resources.},
